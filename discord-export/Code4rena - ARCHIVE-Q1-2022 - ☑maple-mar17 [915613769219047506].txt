Should help to give higher-level context into how things work

can somebody help me , trying to compile the tests, not sure if this is because of dapp.tools (which i was also unable to install ) but i was thinking truffle test , should still run . But it cannot access the modules contracts

Hey @Lucas Manuel | Maple can you help with the above ? ☝️


[06-Dec-21 09:47 PM] broccolirob#8828
The modules folder contains submodules that point to other git repos, so they need to be initialized when you first pull down a repo that contains them. Try running `git submodule update --init --recursive` in the root directory of the project, then try running the test command again and see if that does the trick.


[07-Dec-21 05:19 AM] Lucas Manuel | Maple#7833
Yes exactly^


[07-Dec-21 08:31 AM] Fulcrum#6781
Awesome, thanks for your help it worked .

Hi there! Revenue Distribution Token (RDT) is planned to be used first in our xMPL contract to distribute protocol earnings to users denominated in MPL. After that we are planning to use it in our new PoolV2 and CoverV2 contracts to accrue value to cover and liquidity providers.

Ah thanks for pointing this out, we need to remove this file. We used to build our contracts using standard JSON and dapptools but since moving to foundry we no longer require it.

Running `make test` will build the contracts if you need to access the JSON files in the /out directory.


[20-Mar-22 03:00 PM] IllIllI#0040
That seems to be failing too:

Can you run `git submodule status --recursive`?
